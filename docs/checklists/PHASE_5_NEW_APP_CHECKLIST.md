## ⚠️ Bundle ID Strategy — May 2026

| Platform | Bundle ID | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | `com.togafrica.mquiz` | Existing Play Store users get a seamless OTA upgrade |
| **iOS** | `com.togafrica.mquiz` | First-ever submission — no similarity risk (brand new code) |

**Do NOT use a new bundle ID like `com.mquiz.learn`.** Keeping the same Android ID retains all existing users without requiring a reinstall.

---
